* [Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Ruby automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

* Install Ruby and gem on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.
  * For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
  * For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
  ```
  * For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:
  ```bash
  brew install ruby
  ```
* To run tests in parallel you will require the [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) gem.
* LambdaTest binary file for running tests on your locally hosted web pages.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

Clone the LambdaTest‚Äôs [RSpec-Selenium repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/RSpec-Selenium-Sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/RSpec-Selenium-Sample.git
cd RSpec-Selenium-Sample
```
After navigating to the cloned directory, install project dependencies using the below commands:
```bash
bundle install
```
### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts with Jest on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=RSpec-Selenium-Sample) or through LambdaTest Profile.

Set LambdaTest Username and Access Key in environment variables.
 * For Linux/macOS:
 `export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`
 * For Windows:
 `set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`

## Run Your First Test

### Sample Test with RSpec Ruby

**Test Scenario:** The example mentioned in the [lambdatest.rb](https://github.com/LambdaTest/RSpec-Selenium-Sample/blob/master/scripts/lambdatest.rb) sample file would help you to execute your automation test using RSpec.

> You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=RSpec-Selenium-Sample)**.

## Executing The Test

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the sample of RSpec Ruby and run the following command.
```bash
bundle exec rake single
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on LambdaTest automation dashboard. [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=RSpec-Selenium-Sample) will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Running the Parallel Tests Using RSpec Framework

### Executing the Parallel Tests 
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the sample of RSpec Ruby and run the following command.
```bash
bundle exec rake parallel
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=RSpec-Selenium-Sample).

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=RSpec-Selenium-Sample) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here‚Äôs how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user‚Äôs login email} -key {user‚Äôs access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```ruby
caps = {             
            ...          
            :tunnel => true,         
            ...
        }  
```
Use the below command for running a local test.
```bash
bundle exec rake local
```
